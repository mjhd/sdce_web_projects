<h2>My Application Portfolio</h2>
<p>
My project was a portfolio of the web apps I have built in my semester at Palomar College. They are all HTML5 based apps with jQuery and JavaScript accents. 
The Responsive design is simplistic, just basic stacking of containers. The feature of the project is the swinging iPhone action and load saving architecture. 
Rather than call in massive amounts of unused information from the get, I created a single iframe, which is dynamically replaced and re-assigned a src attribute
each time it is used. Hopefully that feature will shine through the lack of intensive design, the project is lightning fast on a phone so thats a plus!!
