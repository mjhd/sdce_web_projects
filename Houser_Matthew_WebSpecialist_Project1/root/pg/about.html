<p>The Framework Factory is an informational service built from experience, long nights, frustration, hours and hours of debugging, success, & of course failure. 
The goal being that my hours of late night coding and rebuilding projects can impart some lasting wisdom on those who are foolish enough to aspire to 
be web developers. In that time the frameworks and tools I have used have shaped my outcomes, the path and process to those outcomes, and me as a web developer.
In all of this I have discovered two things and two things only: there will always be another problem to solve and that problem, in all likelihood, could have been
prevented. This is an unbreakable cycle, to which you must commit yourself totally, and it will not be easy or expedient. However the rewards for battles won 
and challenges overcome, though fleeting, are precious beyond all measure. That being said the price to your sanity will be steep and there is no certainty 
you will survive the journey. This is your final chance, this way is not for the faint of heart, turn back now if you will or prepare yourself for certain 
doom ye foolhardy enough to pass here - and never say you weren't warned...</p><h2 class="mjhd">&Therefore;MJHd</h2>
