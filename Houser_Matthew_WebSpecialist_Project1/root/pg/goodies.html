<h1>Templates, Bootstraps, & Bases</h1>

<article class="row">
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.initializr.com/"><h2>HTML5 Initializer</h2></a>
<p>Initializer is a fantastic little tool that creates a custom, blank, HTML5 template to build on based on your custom specifications. It includes custom classes, responsive defaults, and Bootstrap as well 
as modernizr for backwards compatibility, or fully customizable HTML5 Polyfills.</p>
</li>

<p>jQuery4u is a jQuery centered page with templates, plugins, bootstraps and information. At this point I should probably explain the Twitter Bootstrap is a name for a specific bootstrap. A bootstrap

<h1>Validators and Minifiers</h1>

<article class="row">
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/"><h2>W3C Validation Service</h2></a>
<p><ul>THE</ul>Validator. The W3C Validator is the absolute go to and most important as the W3C maintains the most widely regarded "official" web standards. ALWAYS use this validator for final validation</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.validome.org/"><h2>Validome</h2></a>
<p>Validome is another great validator that offers more languages and standards than the W3C validator does. This should ONLY be used to generally guide practices not thoroughly covered by the W3C validator and should ALWAYS be double checked</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/"><h2>Google Closure Compiler</h2></a>
<p>Google's Closure Compiler is a multi purpose JavaScript minifier that will remove blank spaces and simple errors or redundancies. It also checks syntax, searches for unused or valueless variables and blank functions, producing what its site 
refers to as "better JavaScript" - I agree! Generally any utility offered by Google is top notch and they really outdid themselves with Closure Compiler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://compressmycode.com/"><h2>CompressMyCode</h2></a>
<p>CompressMyCode is not nearly as functional or useful as Google Closure Compiler for JavaScript, however it can minify HTML and CSS for web apps (or websites though I don't recommend doing so) which is particularly useful for mobile apps and AJAX assets.</p>

</ul>
