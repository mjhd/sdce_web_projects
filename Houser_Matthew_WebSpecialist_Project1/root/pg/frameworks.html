<h1>HTML5 & CSS</h1>

<article class="row">
<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is a fantastic little framework from some of the people who brought you Twitter. It includes a CSS scaffolding that is exceptionally responsive 
and highly customizable. It comes coupled with normalize.css as a reset (which preserves useful defaults while neutralizing disruptive ones) to insure 
a universal appearance in all browsers. It also includes a host of other useful things like Google's HTML5 shim for backwards compatibility, some graphic 
elements and UI assets, pagination, transitions, dropdown menus, and more! Whats more its incredibly easy to customize and modify...
All in all one of the best front end design tools I have ever used.</p> <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">-Visit Site</a>

<article class="row">
<h2>Foundation</h2>
<p>Foundation like Bootstrap is first and foremost a grid based, responsive, css design framework. It is however a bit more suited to nesting layouts
within layouts, making it a bit more suited for complex designs and busy applications/pages. Foundation is built on what essentially amounts to a scripting 
language called Sass. Sass has been getting alot of attention over the past few years because it completly sidesteps writing CSS at all! Instead you 
write in a Ruby based syntax using Sass' classes, nested rules, and variable-selector combos, and your Sass will be interperated into semantically
sound efficiant and cross browser CSS3. Foundation does not contain any of the UI assets Bootstrap does, so a DOM logic library will need to be introduced
seperatly.</p> <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">-Visit Site</a>

<article class="row">
<h2>Less</h2>
<p>Less is very similar to Foundation. It is a SASS based CSS scripting language that compiles to CSS. It also allows nested rules and reusing rules
already written for a prior class to reduce code and ensure uniform appearances. It's strengths over Foundation is that it uses a more CSS like 
syntax and uses standard CSS3 as a fallback when scripting is impractical. It can be used client side or server side for client load reduction.

<h2>HTML5 Boilerplate</h2>
<p>A template that has everything you need and nothing you don't. It makes HTML5 function right off the bat, its cross browser, and it degrades nicely.
Most importantly,IT'S FAST. The performance capabilities of HTML5 are greatly enhanced by the inclusion of caching and compression rules and pre-built JavaScript
classes that eliminate the need to hand code common redundant functionality or ever have to repeat or slightly modify your code.</p> <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">-Visit Site</a>

<h1>DOM Logic</h1>

<article class="row">
<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p>Without a doubt the most brand name family of JavaScript libraries, UI, & mobile framework. What can be said about jQuery other than to say if you
don't know it, learn it - and love it, because it's here to stay. What makes it so special? It is the most precisly cross browser compatible... anything.
Nothing goes so nicly with IE and Firefox with such ease. Simplified syntax, ever built AJAX applications by hand? with jQuery the XMLHttpRequest Object and
Microsofts alternative ActiveX, and the if if if if if if game to determin which to use and how to handle AJAX response is simplified to 
.load() .replace() .post() and .get() with only a few basic perameters. Its transitions are flawless, and the UI elements are light and well thought out.
Not to mention any framework, template, or bootstrap will have been designed to be compatible with jQuery - if its not there is a very convenient noConflict class 
as well.</p> <a href="http://jquery.com/">-Visit Site</a>

<article class="row">
<h2>DOJO</h2>
<p>DOJO is an awesome little toolkit. It's physically smaller than jQuery which can be important at times. Of course its not nearly as robust, but for simple 
DHTML solutions jQuery is sometimes overkill. This is where DOJO shines, especially if you have no need for the jQuery UI or your working mostly with
data manipulation rather than DOM manipulation. It goes great with node.js for data driven applications and includes a nifty graphics API for dynamic 
graphic generation that isn't to heavy for mobile devices or slow connections.</p> <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">-Visit Site</a>

<article class="row">
<h2>ProtoType</h2>
<p>ProtoTypeJS is a nice middleground between hand coding and having a fully structured framework. It ALWAYS has the best performance over its rivals in 
terms of loadtime, client load, and failed outcomes, parsing errors, and functional lag. That being said, it is much more labor intensive and doesn't 
include many of the features other frameworks have perfected and developers have come to expect.</p> <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">-Visit Site</a>

<h1>Graphics & Rendering</h1>

<article class="row">
<h2>D3.js</h2>
<p>D3.js is built to do 1 thing: generate SVG's. It can dynamically update or replace graphics, scale and zoom, and alter graphics in color, proportion, or shape.
It's ideal for dynamic data representation, updated by XML, Django, or PHP scripts. It can be updated realtime or change based on user interaction. All in 
all the finest JS frameworg for graphics.</p> <a href="http://d3js.org/">-Visit Site</a>
</article>

<article class="row">
<h2>Raphaël</h2>
<p>The D3 alternative. I will admit I have not use Raphaël much. I was immediatly attracted to D3 because of the API shotcomings of Raphaël. It is however
lighter, faster, and easier to use. Probably better for beginners not used to JavaScript or client side SVG generation.</p> <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">-Visit Site</a>

<h1>Data Modeling - Structuring - Delivery</h1>

<article class="row">
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p>If you only ever learn one major server side JavaScript framework make sure its Node. An industry standard for serverside applications that assist development
of web apps, websites, and make developers less dependant on other technologies. Highly stable and perfect for advanced applications. node.js is rivalled only by 
Django(python) and PHP scripting for ease of use combined with data control functionality. Node.js can handle massive amounts of Async calls due to its server side nature 
and makes updating 20,000 users a day possible. The best part is Node has such a strong developer community that often times a solution for your particular need has already been
developed and refined! Now you can put your JavaScript knowledge to use on big projects, like LinkdIN for example, whos AJAX updates and JSON modules are handled by node.js!</p>

<article class="row">
<h2>Backbone.js</h2>
<p>Backbone is a friendly JavaScript based MVC. A Model View Controller represents data (which can be responses from node.js or Django for example) as a model.
This model can be modified at any time or used in any way, including returning well formatted data to pre-built objects dynamically. Backbone is particularly suited
to mobile environments as devices don't have the computing power to be processing data into a useful format over and over and over. So much so the 
combination of Backbone and jQuery mobile is widely known as Jackbone (and is a rockstar!). Imagine if your phone was responsible for handling all the data 
from its Facebook app! It would crash constantly. Instead this can be done server side and pushed to an app prepared to be placed into HTML containers. 
This way clients and apps aren't burdened with massive amounts of calculations and sorting responsibilities.</p> <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">-Visit Site</a>

<article class="row">
<h2>AngularJS</h2>
<p>Angular.js - the framework of tomorrow! Angular is essentially backbone on steroids and written by control freaks! It really leaves very little to the 
imagination and requires very little problem solving but emphasizes building compatibility. Personally I think its to constrictive, but I can't deny it 
is very inclusive. A project built on Angular has virtually no dependencies, which is a partial counter to its larger KB size when compared to Backbone, which
will always need other frameworks to function. Angular by contrast is highly declarative and can declare changes in the DOM, making DOM manipulation 
unnecessary. Angular also offers an exceptional MVC facet and makes data related frameworks unnecessary as well. Strictly speaking, an application or website
could run on Angular augmented HTML alone and be completely dynamic and highly intuitive, without even so much as jQuery (although you will likely want to include 
jQuery as well) or other server side scripting.</p> <a href="http://angularjs.org/">-Visit Site</a>

<article class="row">
<h2>Underscore.js</h2>
<p>Underscore.js, billed as "the tie to go along with jQuery's tux, and Backbone.js's suspenders" by its homesite. Underscore is an addition to other frameworks who's job is
to live in the space between DOM interaction and data. That is to say, prior to information being on a web page it will undoubtedly be acted upon by a data
centric framework (Node.js & Backbone). These data driven frameworks are usually not terrific at delivering data, especially with very intricate UI's. The
job of reconciling data to UI is usually left to the DOM framework (jQuery) but this often involves function in function in function in function processes and
complex binding in DOM frameworks that is heavy and sluggish, not to mention will often crash older browsers and even newer browsers on out of date computers. Enter underscore!
Underscore takes these responsibilities on and handles them long before DOM generation on the server based on MVC constructs like backbone. It doesn't handle 
the data structuring but rather the pre DOM functionality that would otherwise be left to your browser after an HTTP request. Underscore represents the middle-ground
between server side and DOM generation on the client side so you need not rely on a users computer to have the resources necessary nor IE to be stable enough
to get the job done. Think of it as chewing food before consumption, it makes digesting a bit easier!</p> <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">-Visit Site</a>
