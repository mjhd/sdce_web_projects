<p>
A common misconception when we are taught about our solar system is how little astronomers actually know about it... If fact since the launch of the hubble space telescope astronomers have learned so much about other solar systems in the universe that the traditional model of our solar system is under severe fire.</p>

<p>
Recurring theme throughout the universe is that systems tend to be binary - comprised of two suns, and they tend to be not just eliptical but that in fact most solar systems of similar mass are now predicted to be at leas 200 million times wider than our own. An odd coincidence that we would be so uniquly shaped and happen to also be our only source of self observed information. 
</p>
</div>

<h1 style="padding-top:5px;">The Premis:</h1>

<em>
Is it possible that our solar system does not violate all the new cosmic rules? It is possible that our solar system is considerably physically larger than it appears and that there are more planets in longer eliptical orbits?
</em>

</div>
<div class="left">
<h2>So what then why have we never observed other planets?</h2>
<p> Whether our solar system was once binary, and there is a dead twin sun floating away from our formar polar orbit due to the mild supernova at the end of its life, it would not just change the model of the solar system - It would allow for the existance of planets that simply cannot be easily found examining 3 dimentional space. Its much easyer to examin systems far away to learn about our own...
</p>

<p> This play of angles is something you've undoubtedly experienced before... An image for example taken close to a subject, creates the illusion that they are holding an enourmouse object, like the Eiffel Tower, in there hand. When examining large bodies its very difficult to establish perspective when your foreground is considerably closer than your backroud - the Z:Y dimensional conflict.
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="story2">So... In other words, there not only could be leftover planets still circaling this former orbit, its nearly absurd to suppose that there arent!</h2>

</div>
<div class="left">
<h2>So how do people know of PlanetX?</h2>
<p> Ancient Sumerians spoke of people who came from another planet they had catalogued in the night sky. Oddly enough, despite being expert astronomers, the Sumerians seemed to think that there was another planet that orbited the sun. They also predicted at this planet had a much longer year than ours (solar orbit) and that it would only be visible in the night sky every once in a great while before dissapearing deap into "the heavens"</p>

<p> However there is a problem with the ancient Sumerian tale... They didn't know the sun was the center of the solar system, they couldn't have possibly observed Pluto, and of course wouldn't be aware of the tremendous likelyhood that our solar system was once binary and eliptical in nature.
</p>

</div>
<h1>So this ancient sumerian knowledge is supposed to have come from a higher power - or another intelligent species!</h1>

<h1 class="storyhead">Knowledge beyond means</h1>
<img src="img/nibiru.jpg" class="storyhead" />
</div>
<div class="left">
<h2>So where are you going with this?</h2>
<p> The Sumerians also included one more groundbreaking peace of information - That these Nibiru came by every 3600 years. An odd figure for a civilization who also didn't know that the earth is increadibly old. Sumer is beleived to have been settled around 4500 BC, however it is belevied that most of the artifacts found that show knowledge beyond possible means come from a type of enlightenment beggining in 2900 BC. This is a span of 1600 years, during which time the Sumerians say, there "gods" lived among them, and at the end of there time together, gave them all the advanced knowledge they had learned...</p>

<p>If you consider the 3600 year statuate, 1600 years would be the time-range when Nibiru would be at its closest. So in 2900 BC these being can no longer make the trip to Earth, they give us all this knowledge, and dissapear.

<h2>The time lines up!</h2>
<p> If you examin the timeline, there are obvious implications of the timetables overlapping one another. I think the end conversation becomes apparant... The Irish have undoubtedly had exposure to our glorious Anunaki overlords! To what capacity were they in contact? It is unclear. However I would venture to guess perhaps that the Irish helped buid the first intergalactic railroad. Whatever the purpose the legacy left to us by the Sumerians makes it clear, there are no technological coincidences!</p>

<p>Today the nation of Ireland has an Atypically small population, nearly colony perportioned... A work camp? Awaiting the return of the Anunaki to begin doing there bidding once again?? Only more scientific study can tell!
